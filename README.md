Incomplete features

- failed to get generated spring boot jar to run from the command line.... it's been a few years since I've had to write Spring boot apps, and if I spent a bit more time on this I could work out what I did wrong,
   but going by the problem specification, I gather that you don't want me spending too much time on the problem...

- after writing a couple of unit test classes for the first two classes I developed, I realised that I was spending too much time on the test classes, so rather than writing them to test the classes I then produced, I thought it best to just go ahead with the app code development. With more time, there would be sufficient test coverage available
